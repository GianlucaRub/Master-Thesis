Here there are the initial experiments that I did with alibaba dataset.
In particular the data exploration is performed in the following notebooks:
- Gianluca - Alibaba Dataset Exploration, where I computed high level statistics on the entire dataset;
- Gianluca - Trace Exploration Alibaba 0, where I analyzed the composition of the traces using just one part of the dataset;
- Gianluca - Timing Exploration Alibaba, where I analyzed the response time of the calls;

The other notebooks are experiments for data preparation and processing for training, and training experiments, where I did some practice with Pykeen library.
