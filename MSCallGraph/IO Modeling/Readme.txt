The dataset obtained has been used to create the trace test dataset.
However, by removing the "traceid" column and then removing the duplicates, it is possible to obtain the dataset that can be split in training and testing as it happens for the traditional prediction scenario.
It is equivalent to the "reduced" Static dataset.
Moreover, it contains also the notebook used for the creation of the tsv files that used for the IO Trace-based prediction.
TSV Fixer IO has been used to fix the wrong formatting of the tsv files created in the previously cited notebooks.
The tsv files obtained are in Traning and Testing\All data folder
